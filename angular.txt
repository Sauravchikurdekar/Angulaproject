1. What is Angular?
Answer: Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application
 framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs).

2. What are the key features of Angular?
Answer:

Modularity: Angular applications are modular and organized into various modules.
Component-based Architecture: Angular uses components to build the user interface.
Dependency Injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system to manage object creation and provide components with services.
Directives: Angular allows you to create custom HTML tags (directives) for better reusability.
Templates and Data Binding: Angular offers two-way data binding and templates for building dynamic views.
Services: Angular services are singleton objects used for encapsulating and sharing data and behavior across components.
Routing: Angular provides a powerful router for building single-page applications.
3. What is TypeScript?
Answer: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds static types to the language,
 making it easier to maintain and scale large applications. Angular is built using TypeScript.

4. What is data binding in Angular?
Answer: Data binding in Angular refers to the synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI). There are four types of data binding in Angular:

Interpolation: {{ data }}
Property Binding: [property]="data"
Event Binding: (event)="handler()"
Two-way Binding: [(ngModel)]="data"
5. What is Angular CLI?
Answer: Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool for initializing, developing, scaffolding,
 and maintaining Angular applications. It automates common development tasks and provides a consistent development environment.

6. Explain Angular Modules.
Answer: Angular Modules are containers for a group of related components, directives, services, and pipes. They help
 in organizing the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Every Angular application has at least one module, known as the root module (AppModule).

7. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
Answer: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in Angular where components and services are given their dependencies 
instead of creating them internally. It helps in managing and organizing the objects that a class needs to perform its functions.

8. What are Angular Services?
Answer: Angular services are singleton objects that are used to organize and share business logic, data, or functions
 across an Angular application. They are injectable and can be injected into components and other services.

9. Explain Observables in Angular.
Answer: Observables are a powerful way to manage asynchronous data streams. They are used extensively in Angular for handling events,
 asynchronous requests, and handling multiple values over time. Observables can be used with Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP requests.

10. What is Angular Routing?

Answer: Angular Routing is a mechanism that allows navigation between different components based on the URL changes. 
It helps in building Single Page Applications (SPAs) by dynamically loading different components based on the route requested by the user.

Remember, it's essential to not only know the answers but also understand the concepts behind these questions to succeed in an Angular interview. Good luck!




Basic Angular Interview Questions:
What is Angular?

Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google and a community 
of developers. It's used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs).
What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?

AngularJS is the first version of Angular, often referred to as Angular 1.x. Angular, commonly known as Angular
 2+, is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and has significant architectural changes.
What are components in Angular?

Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. They are directives with a template, data,
 and behavior. They encapsulate the view, data, and logic of a component.
What is data binding in Angular?

Data binding in Angular allows synchronization between the model (component) and the view (DOM).
 There are four types of data binding in Angular: Interpolation, Property binding, Event binding, and Two-way binding.
Explain Angular Modules.

Angular Modules (NgModules) are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain,
 workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
Intermediate Angular Interview Questions:
What is dependency injection in Angular?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external
 sources rather than creating them itself. Angular has its own DI framework which provides services to the components.
What are services in Angular?

Services are objects that are used to organize and share business logic, data, or functions across an
 Angular application. They can be injected into components or other services to provide functionality.
What are directives in Angular?

Directives are instructions in the DOM. In Angular, directives are used to create custom attributes for 
elements or components. There are three types of directives: Component Directives, Structural Directives, and Attribute Directives.
Explain Angular CLI.

Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain
 Angular applications. It allows developers to create components, services, modules, etc., with just a few commands.
What is RxJS in Angular?

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, making it easier to compose asynchronous or
 callback-based code. It provides powerful operators for transforming, composing, and querying streams of data.
Advanced Angular Interview Questions:
What is Angular Universal?

Angular Universal is a technology that allows server-side rendering of Angular applications. This
 improves performance and facilitates web crawlers in indexing the Angular app.
Explain lazy loading in Angular.

Lazy loading is a technique in Angular where you can load feature modules only when the user navigates to their
 routes. It helps in optimizing the initial loading time of the application.
What is AOT compilation in Angular?

AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation is a technique in Angular where the application is compiled at build time, converting
 the Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process. It improves the performance of the application.
What are Angular forms?

Angular forms allow you to capture user input and validate it before sending it to the server. There are two types
 of forms in Angular: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms (model-driven forms).
Explain Angular Change Detection.

Angular Change Detection is the mechanism used by Angular to keep the DOM in sync with the application data. Whenever 
the application data changes, Angular automatically updates the view to reflect those changes.
